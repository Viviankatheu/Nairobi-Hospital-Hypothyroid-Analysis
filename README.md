# Nairobi-Hospital-Hypothyroid-Analysis 
#Author: Vivian Katheu

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:    Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Hypothyroidism means that the thyroid gland can't make enough thyroid hormone to keep the body running normally. People are hypothyroid if they have too little thyroid hormone in the blood.
The thyroid gland main function is releasing and controlling thyroid hormones that control metabolism. If the body makes too much thyroid hormone, you can develop a condition called hyperthyroidism. If the body makes too little thyroid hormone, itâ€™s called hypothyroidism.
Common causes are autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, surgical removal of the thyroid, and radiation treatment.
Thyroid disease can be up to eight times more likely in women than men.

Some of the terminologies used in this dataset are:
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) - rises whenever the thyroid gland fails to produce sufficient thyroid hormone. When there is too much thyroid hormone present in the serum, the brain responds by lowering the TSH. It is High in hyperthyroidism and Low in hypothyroidism.
Thyroid binding globulin(TBG) - plasma proteins. Triiodothyronine (T3) - High in hyperthyroidism and Low in hypothyroidism.
Total thyroxine (TT4) - High in hyperthyroidism and Low in hypothyroidism. It is usually slightly High during pregnancy because of increased levels of TBG.
Free Thyroxine Index (FTI) - considered a more reliable indicator of thyroid status and is High in hyperthyroidism and Low in hypothyroidism.
